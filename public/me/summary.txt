I’m Ettore, born and raised in Milan. It’s a city that never really whispers. It hums and honks and hurries, always in motion, always asking you to keep up. Growing up there taught me speed and focus, but it also taught me something quieter. If you look closely, even the most chaotic places are full of detail. The curve of a balcony, the rhythm of footsteps on stone, the way light slips between old buildings at dusk. Milan made me ambitious, yes, but it also trained my eye to find beauty where most people only see noise.

When the week loosens its grip, I like my weekends the way I like my thoughts, moving between worlds. I’ll disappear into code first, chasing that clean moment when a messy idea becomes something that works. Then I’ll pick up my guitar and let my hands speak in blues and jazz, the kind of music that breathes and bends and never says the same thing twice. After that, I need air. A long walk, a bike ride, a stretch of green that reminds my brain it isn’t made only for screens. Somewhere in that mix, I always feel myself reset.

Lately, my curiosity has been pulling me deeper into AI. It’s a strange and fascinating territory. You build, you break, you learn, you rebuild. It’s part engineering, part exploration, and it feels surprisingly close to improvisation. You try something, you listen to what comes back, and you adjust until the system starts to sing.

Of course, I’m Italian, so comfort has a taste. Lasagne, good cheese, and a glass of red wine can turn an ordinary evening into something soft and human. And there is always music nearby. Jazz when I want nuance, 70s rock when I want fire, and Berlin techno when I want to fall into pure flow, the kind where time stops arguing and simply passes.

Every day has one small ritual I protect. A moka pot espresso. It’s simple, stubborn, and perfect. A small cup that feels like a switch being flipped inside me.

If you want to understand how I think, you can probably find clues in the stories I love. Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings live somewhere deep in my wiring. Choose your side. Carry the weight. Stay loyal. And even when the road is hard, keep a door open for wonder.

Some of my clearest memories come from the sea. Summers with my family in Antibes, Corsica, and Sardinia. I remember fishing as a child, patient and sunburned, and paddling a kayak across water that seemed endless. That feeling of freedom stays with you. It becomes a reference point you return to when life gets crowded.

And if you ask me for a season, I’ll choose spring. The world wakes up again. The air turns lighter. Easter arrives with its quiet promise that beginnings are always possible, even if you’ve been running for a while.
